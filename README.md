# SecurityPricing

This is a project created as a development test for Avanan. This is a mock-up pricing page for their services. It is built with HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Below is a bulleted list of some of the reasons I chose to make certain design choices.

Here is a youtube video covering the topics in this document: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avnEs8UoEsg

- Have a large image upon first page load: I decided to do this when I took a look at a lot of the other pricing pages for successful companies on the web. Have a large image with some copy over it seems to be a popular and modern style right now.

- Go with a blue theme and mostly blue buttons: I have done a lot of reading on the psycology of web sales and there are certain things with enough research where it is almost a science. I have read numerous times that blue is a trustworthy color in the eyes of a consumer.

- Give specific names to the service bundles: This is something I think makes it easier on the consumer, it is easier tp remember the names of these bundle and which one is best for them.

- Consolidate the feature list of each bundle: I did this to save space on screen real esate. I feel as though that is especially important with mobile browsing growing year after year. I want to add a link with a modal (pop-up box) to display a more comprehensive chart of the features, this way the user can get the best of both worlds.

- Have the FAQ hidden until clicked on: I did this much for the same reason I consolidated the features of each bundle, so save on screen real estate and give the user the option to look at it if they choose to.

- A possible upgrade I could make it to add a small carousel of client logos underneath the bottom form, as social proof for the services provided. I would probably edit the logos to be in grayscale instead of color becuase it is a little bit more sleek and modern.
